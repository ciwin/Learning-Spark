# Learning Spark
This is my repository of my Spark experiments while reading the book *Learning Spark* by Jules S. Damji, Brooke Wenig, Tathagata Das and Denny Lee ([available as pdf from Databricks](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf)).

I only run the experiments in Python. The book contains code snippets in Python, Scala and Java. In the book, not all snippets and programs are available in all languages. I will try to  write all snippets in executable and tested Python code (mostly in Jupyter Notebooks).

This repository also contains the end-to-end examples from the book's [github repository](https://github.com/databricks/LearningSparkV2), which are originally saved in a Databricks Notebook (`.dbc file`). I have converted the Python files into Jupyter Notebooks and saved them in the folder `BookExamples`.

## Status

Chapter 2 and 3 are complete.
