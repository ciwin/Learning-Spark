# Spark
This is my repository of my Spark experiments while reading the book *Learning Spark* by Jules S. Damji, Brooke Wenig, Tathagata Das and Denny Lee ([available as pdf from Databricks](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf)).

I only run the experiments in Python. The book contains code snippets in Python, Scala and Java. In the book, not all snippets and programs are available in all languages. I will try to  write all snippets in executable and tested Python code (mostly in Jupyter Notebooks).

## Status

Chapter 2 is done. I am currently working on chapter 3.
